# Android app for YHE BP Doctor Smart Watch

This project provides an Android app for the YHE BP Doctor Smart Watch that doesn't require any cloud services.

The smart watch does not work as a watch without first initializing it using an external device.

So you might want to use our Android app to initialize your watch and to set the time and date on the watch.

If you wish, you can then remove the Android app again--it will not bother the watch.
